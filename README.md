# GitHub for Antvel discussion

These can include discussions regarding modifying existing Antvel behavior or proposing new features for the project. However, if you are proposing a new feature, you should be willing to code the feature if possible.

Formal Antvel development discussion takes place on the #antvel channel of slack.
